PRODIGY_DS_01 – Data Visualization Task

📌 Task Overview
In this task, I worked with an Indian population dataset and performed data cleaning and visualization using Python (Pandas & Matplotlib).

📂 What I Did

Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame

Checked for missing or null values

Cleaned the data (removed unnecessary columns)

Created Visualizations:
✔️ Histograms: Male and Female population distribution
✔️ Bar Charts: Area and Population Density of states/UTs
🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Outcome
This task helped me gain practical experience in:

Loading and cleaning datasets

Handling missing values

Plotting histograms and bar charts

Visualizing population distribution across Indian states/UTs
